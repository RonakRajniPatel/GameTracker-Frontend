# GameTracker
This is a backlog game tracker that allows users to track the games they play with metrics such as hours, ratings, reviews and other key details. Reverted before starting web dev simplified tutorial.

You are also able to keep track of the status of the game as in are you playing it, have you dropßped it, have you completed it, or do you want to play it.

These details would be comparable to other users in the form of friends. You'll be able to see what your friends thought of a game and other all their key details.
